# Astral-Games-Yasuke
Project Yasuke was created and conceptualized by Cole Andrews. 

The original project dates back to Jan of 2023 but the first build was created in May of 2023. 

This project was developed over two months with the final version being completed in early August 2024. Yasuke is no longer in active development and should be treated only as a prototype of a much larger idea.
